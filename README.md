**BrainDump** is a fast, minimal, and intuitive note-taking tool — built to feel like scribbling a thought on the palm of your hand.

It’s instant, distraction-free, and made for moments when you just need to **dump your brain**, not manage a wiki.

|--------------------|--------------|-----------|

| No login needed    | ✅            | ❌ (account required) |
| Mobile-friendly    | ✅            | ⚠️ (clunky UI) |
| Distraction-free   | ✅            | ❌ (menus, blocks, clutter) |

**BrainDump is for the creative thinker who just wants to write, fast.**
